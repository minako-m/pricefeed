#Pricefeed Processer for Kaspi Marketplace

Kaspi Marketplace is one of the largest online shopping platforms in Kazakhstan, owned by Kaspi Bank. In this project, we automated the process of recieving pricefeed data from merchants in such formats as Excel or XML and translating them into a uniform format. We used Kafka and MongoDB for real-time dataset management. 

To analyze project performance, we used Prometheus metrics.
